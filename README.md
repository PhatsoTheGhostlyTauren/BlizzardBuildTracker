## About

Phatso's Blizzard Build Tracker allows you to grab and track Builds for Blizzard Games like World of Warcraft,
Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, Starcraft and Hearthstone.
It uses Log Messages and Audio Cues to keep you updated, so that you'll be guaranteed to be
the first one spamming Twitch Channels with the good news.
